## Social Issues
Accessability could be a problem, as there are no options to change the font size.

## Ethical Issues
The website does not collect any data from site visitors, and therefore does not, and cannot share or store any personal data without their explicit permission.

## Legal Issues
Legal liabilities could possibly arise if any advice a user takes from the app turns out to be detrimental.
