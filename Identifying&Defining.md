The screen time management app scored highest on the impact level and lowest on the effort level. In a world increasingly reliant on technology to function, the application will be launched in the midst of a massive opportunity, with the added strengths of being easy to maintain. The diet assistant app scored similarly on the impact/effort matrix, but did not have as big of an opportunity. Online messaging, general news, and positive stories were all high impact, but high effort - unfavourable compared to its low effort alternatives. The entertainment venue finder was easily the worst option out of the four, due to both a low impact and requiring high effort.

As a result, the final application chosen for development will be the Screen Time Management App.

# Requirements Outline

## Functional Requirements

Purpose of the Application - The application will allow users to view advice on how to manage their screen time effectively, as well as provide a timer to assist them in this goal.


Use Cases - Users will select buttons on the top screen bar to switch between two screens. One screen is a screen of information about the website, its goal, and handy information about how the viewer can manage their screen time, and the other is a countdown timer which the viewer can set to a certain time for it to count down to 0 from - handy for creating limits for screen time.


Test Cases - When the user presses either button in the top bar, the app will switch to the corresponding screen. On the countdown timer screen, when the user presses a button in that section, the timer will be modified accordingly.

## Non-Functional Requirements

Performance - The app will run smoothly with little lag. Navigation between screens should take no longer than 1.5 seconds, and each input in the countdown timer should take no longer than 0.5 seconds.


Usability - The website will use larger-than-normal font sizes, and will have a consistent, easy to navigate layout.


Security - The site does not collect user data.
